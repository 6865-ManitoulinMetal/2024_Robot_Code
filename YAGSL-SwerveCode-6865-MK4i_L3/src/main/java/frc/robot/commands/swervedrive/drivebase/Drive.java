   * @param vY                DoubleSupplier that supplies the y-translation joystick input.  Should be in the range -1
   * @param rX                       to 1 with deadband already accounted for.  Positive Y is towards the left wall when
   *                          looking through the driver station glass.
   *   DoubleSupplier that supplies the vertical component of the robot's heading angle.  In the
   *                          robot coordinate system, this is along the same axis as vX.  Should range from -1 to 1
